    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    AD:C5:3D:49:2F:B7:BA:C5:B7:E2:EB:66:B4:A8:35:9E:C5:39:B3:B5;com.codesmore.codesmore.ui.completeddetails

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
